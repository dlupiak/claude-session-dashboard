# Claude Session Dashboard

A read-only, local observability dashboard for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) sessions. Scans your `~/.claude` directory to visualize session history, tool usage, token consumption, cost estimates, and activity trends -- all without sending data anywhere.

![Sessions Page](screenshots/sessions-page.png)

## Why?

Claude Code stores all session data locally in `~/.claude/projects/`, but there is no built-in way to browse, search, or analyze past sessions. As you accumulate hundreds of sessions across dozens of projects, questions start piling up:

- How many tokens did that refactoring session actually use?
- Which tools does Claude call most often in my codebase?
- How much am I spending per project, per day, per model?
- Is the context window filling up mid-session?
- When am I most active -- mornings or late nights?

This dashboard gives you answers. It reads your local session files, parses the JSONL logs, and presents everything in a fast, searchable web UI that runs entirely on your machine.

## Features

**Session browsing and search**
- Full-text search across session names, projects, and branches
- Filter by status (active / completed), project, model, and date range
- Sortable columns with pagination
- Active session indicator with real-time status polling

**Session detail view**
- Context window utilization breakdown (input, output, cache read, cache creation)
- Tool usage frequency and duration statistics
- Agent dispatch history with nested tool calls
- Gantt-style timeline chart with zoom controls for tool calls, agent runs, and skill invocations
- Per-session and per-agent cost estimates with per-model and per-category breakdowns

**Analytics and stats**
- GitHub-style contribution heatmap showing token usage intensity over the past year
- Token usage over time -- stacked area chart with daily/weekly toggle, top 5 models + "Other"
- Model usage distribution across all sessions
- Hourly activity distribution chart
- Aggregate metrics: total sessions, messages, tokens, estimated cost

![Stats Overview](screenshots/stats-overview-full.png)

**Per-project analytics**
- Dedicated "Projects" tab with sortable table
- Sessions, messages, tokens, and duration aggregated per project
- Drill-down links to filtered session lists

**Cost estimation**
- Configurable API pricing per model (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4, Haiku, etc.)
- Subscription tier support (Free, Pro, Max 5x/20x) with appropriate rate adjustments
- Settings persisted to `~/.claude-dashboard/settings.json`

**Data export**
- Export stats and session data in CSV or JSON format
- Four export formats: session summaries, model usage, daily activity, project analytics
- Client-side export -- no server round-trip needed

**Real-time monitoring**
- Active sessions badge in the sidebar with 3-second status polling
- Active session banner on detail pages with adaptive refresh intervals
- Automatic data refresh for in-progress sessions

**Privacy mode**
- Toggle to anonymize project names, file paths, branch names, and usernames
- Analytics data anonymized consistently across all views
- Safe for screenshot sharing and presentations

## Quick Start

### Using npx (recommended)

```bash
npx claude-session-dashboard
```

### Using npm (global install)

```bash
npm install -g claude-session-dashboard
claude-dashboard
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker run -v ~/.claude:/home/node/.claude:ro -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/dlupiak/claude-session-dashboard
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlupiak/claude-session-dashboard.git
cd claude-session-dashboard
docker compose up
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlupiak/claude-session-dashboard.git
cd claude-session-dashboard/apps/web
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## CLI Options

```
  -p, --port <number>   Port to listen on (default: 3000)
  --host <hostname>     Host to bind to (default: localhost)
  -o, --open            Open browser after starting
  -v, --version         Show version number
  -h, --help            Show this help message
```

> **Note:** The dashboard runs entirely on localhost and only reads files from `~/.claude`. It never modifies any Claude Code data and never sends data over the network.

```

## How It Works

1. **Scanning** -- The server reads `~/.claude/projects/` to discover all session `.jsonl` files. An mtime-based cache avoids re-parsing unchanged files.
2. **Parsing** -- Session files are parsed to extract metadata (project, branch, duration, model), tool calls, agent dispatches, token usage, and errors.
3. **Server Functions** -- TanStack Start server functions (`createServerFn`) expose parsed data to the client via type-safe RPC. All file I/O stays on the server.
4. **React Query** -- The UI fetches data through React Query with automatic background refetch for live updates. Active sessions use adaptive polling intervals.
5. **Caching** -- Parsed session summaries and heatmap data are cached in memory (mtime-based invalidation) and on disk (`~/.claude-dashboard/cache/`) for fast startup.

## Development
